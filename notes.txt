redux is a state management library.
we can manage and maintain state in a predictable way.
redux toolkit is a library for efficient redux development.
react-redux is a library that provides bindings to use react and redux together in an application. 
we can use redux when we have large amount of application states that are needed in many places in the app.
when the app state is updated frquently over time
when the logic to update the state may be complex
The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people 


three core concepts in redux

1. store -  holds state of the application
2. action -  describes what happened
3. reducer - ties the sotre and actions together

three principbes

1. the global state of your app is stored as an object inside a single store.(state is read only)
2. the only way to change the state i to dispatch an action, an object that discribes what happened
3. to specify how the state tree is updated based on actions, you wirte pure reducers (pure functions)


redux store => app => action = > reducer => redux store

the app cannot update the state of the store directly.
app can update the state in thr store by dispatching an action.
depedns upon actin the reducer will change the state of the sotre

actions are the only the app can intract with store. actions are plain js objects.
